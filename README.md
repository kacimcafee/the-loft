# Questions/Notes for Owners:
   
    Chose to leave off allergy warnings/prices since you can't order online, focus is solely on menu items themselves 

    Do we have any catering photos?

    Do we have PDF of phonebooth stories / transcript for stories? Do we want to include that, or just list the most popular stories people can hear?

    Upload photos from previous location
